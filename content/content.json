        "info": "MBX is a C++ library that provides an interface for molecular dynamics (MD) drivers, such as LAMMPS and i-Pl, to perform classical and path-integral molecular dynamics simulations using data-driven many-body potential energy functions (PEFs) [1]. The current version of MBX includes our MB-pol PEF for water and our MB-nrg PEFs for halide and alkali-metal ions, neat CO2 and mixed CO2/H2O mixtures, neat CH4 and mixed CH4/H2O mixtures, and neat NH3, as well as our MB-nrg PEFS for covalently bonded molecules such as alkanes and N-methyl acetamide.\n\nMBX acts as a client that returns MB-pol and MB-nrg energies and forces while the actual molecular dynamics is controlled by the MD driver. In the case of i-Pl, the communication between MBX and i-PI can be established in two ways: Internet and Unix domain sockets. Please refer to the i-PI manual for more details. For LAMMPS, the MBX interface is added through the combination of specific FIX and PAIR_STYLE commands. Please refer to the LAMMPS manual for more details.\n\nMBX can be downloaded from our GitHub page. The installation instructions, along with specific details about the interfaces with LAMMPS and i-PI, are included in the README file.\n\nQuestions about MBX and the interfaces with LAMMPS and i-PI should be posted on the MBX Google Group. For classical molecular dynamics simulations, we recommend using LAMMPS since it provides better performance with MBX. Since MBX is parallelized using both OpenMP and MPI, the specific combination of OMP threads and MPI tasks in the LAMMPS simulations is sensitive to the system's size.\n\nFor path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, we recommend using i-Pl since it provides a wide set of methods based on path integrals.\n\nThe structure and performance of the current version of MBX are described in Ref. [1]. MBX is under continued development and optimization. All updates are posted on this page and our GitHub page."

In this study, we integrate MB-nrg data-driven many-body potential energy functions with advanced quantum dynamics simulations to uncover how many-body interactions and NQEs shape the structure and vibrational response of hydrated fluoride. Our analysis reveals that short-range three-body interactions between the ion and surrounding water molecules are critical for capturing the infrared spectral features of the first hydration shell, particularly in the OH-stretch and libration regions. We identify distinct reorientation dynamics of OH bonds that give rise to the bifurcation of the libration band. While NQEs induce a redshift in OH-stretching frequencies, they have minimal influence on orientational and translational dynamics. These results underscore the importance of rigorous many-body treatments to achieve predictive accuracy in modeling ion hydration and interpreting vibrational spectra.",

                "description": "Understanding how halide ions affect the structure and dynamics of water at the molecular level is essential for a wide range of chemical, biological, and environmental processes. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations with MB-nrg data-driven many-body potential energy functions to investigate the hydration properties of halide ions in bulk water. The results reveal distinct trends in hydration structure, residence times, dipole moment distributions, and infrared spectral signatures, reflecting variations in ion size, charge density, and polarizability. In particular, fluoride promotes uniquely strong and more directional hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules, which leads to substantial spectral shifts and slower water exchange dynamics. In contrast, heavier halides induce only minimal perturbations on the water hydrogen-bond network, even within the first hydration shell. These insights provide a quantitative framework for understanding ion-specific effects in aqueous systems and set the stage for future studies of more complex environments such as aqueous interfaces and confined systems.",

For the MM subsystem, which lacks orbitals, we assign an ad hoc electron density and apply orbital-free DFT functionals to describe its quantum properties. The interaction between the QM and MM subsystems is also treated using orbital-free density functionals, accounting for Coulomb interactions, exchange, correlation, and Pauli repulsion. Consistency across QM and MM subsystems is ensured by employing data-driven, many-body MM force fields that faithfully represent DFT functionals. Applications to water-solvated systems demonstrate that this approach achieves unprecedented, very rapid convergence to chemical accuracy as the size of the QM subsystem increases. We validate the method with several pilot studies, including water bulk, water clusters (prism hexamer and pentamers), solvated glucose, a palladium aqua ion, and a wet monolayer of MoS2.",

                "answer": "To get the best performance, please check all of these things:\n1) Do not disable compiler optimizations. When you run `configure` don't pass `--disable-optimization`.\n2) For most systems, run on a single MPI rank, with up to 32 OpenMP threads. (which you can set with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=32`)\n4) Don't oversubscribe your cores, or use hardware-level parallelism features. If your processor has 16 physical cores, don't use more OpenMP threads than that.\n5) Bind your threads to nearby cores. It can be helpful to set `OMP_PROC_BIND=\"close\"` and `OMP_PLACES=\"cores\"`.\n6) If your research allows, run multiple shorter simulations rather than one long one. For most equilibrium-state studies, such as RDFs, spectroscopy, etc. many short trajectories work just as well as one long trajectory. Because MBX does not scale well past 32 OpenMP threads for normal box sizes, much greater throughput will be achieved by running multiple simulations with fewer cores rather than one simulation with many cores."
